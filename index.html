  <h1>New York MTA Monthly Ridership</h1>
  <p>Brodie Henson</p>

  <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA, is the regional public transportation agency of New York. The organization includes many services, such as the subway and the New York City Transit, or NYCT, bus. In 2023, the MTA recorded over 1.15 billion rides on the subway and 340 million rides on the NYCT bus (<a href="https://new.mta.info/agency/new-york-city-transit/subway-bus-ridership-2023">Subway</a> and <a href="https://new.mta.info/agency/metro-north-railroad">Metro-North Railroad</a>) Many New York residents use public transit multiple times a day, whether to commute, go to an event or simply to travel to another neighborhood.</p>

        <p>The chart above shows the monthly ridership for the subway, NYCT bus and the Long Island Rail Road, or LIRR. Subway ridership is, by far, the highest among MTA services offered; it is the most used form of public transportation in New York.</p>

        <p>The second chart shows the monthly ridership of the Metro-North Railroad, or MNR, and the Staten Island Railway, or SIR. The MNR, which services the northern part of New York and part of Connecticut, had a higher monthly ridership than the SIR.</p>
